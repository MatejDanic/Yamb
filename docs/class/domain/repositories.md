## 5.1 Domain

### 5.1.3 Repositories

In the Domain of the application, repositories are responsible for interacting with the data store (PostgreSQL or MongoDB). Repositories abstract the underlying database interactions by providing methods to query, retrieve, save, and manage domain entities such as `Player`, `Game`, `Score`, and `Log`.

Repositories extend Spring Dataâ€™s `JpaRepository` or `MongoRepository` interfaces, which provide default methods such as `save()`, `findById()`, and `delete()`. Additional custom queries are also defined to meet the specific needs of the application.

#### GameRepository

Manages the persistence of Game entities, which are stored in MongoDB. This repository focuses on storing and retrieving active, completed, or in-progress games.

  MongoRepository <|-- GameRepository : extends

  class MongoRepository {

  class GameRepository {
    <<Interface>>
    +Optional~Game~ findById(String)
    +List~Game~ findAllByOrderByUpdatedAt()
    +Optional~Game~ findByPlayerIdAndStatusIn(Long, List~GameStatus~)
  }

```
